    <string name="content" translatable="false">Your task is to move the red car from current place
        to the exit of the market\'s parking lot. To do this, you need to move other cars. The car
        placed vertically should be moved in vertical and the car placed horizontally should be
        moved in horizontal. You can tap the car and swipe your finger to move the car, and if your
        way is blocked by other cars, we will not be able to move your car anymore. The time you
        cost and the step you make are counted for the star you get in a mission.</string>
